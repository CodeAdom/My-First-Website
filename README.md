# My Very First Web Page

Welcome! This is my first web page and I'm try to utilise basic coding skills.

## Project Aim

The initial aim of this project is to build a working website using front end development techniques.

## Contents

The site will contain front end development code and tools to demonstrate progression. Each stream will focus on different code utility. The main languages focused on each stream will be:

1. __Stream One__ <br/> *HTML5*, *CSS*, *Javascript*, *Cloud9*, *Git* and *GitHub*.
2. __Stream Two__ <br/> *Python*, *Flask*, *MongoDB*, *MySQL*, *Git* and *GitHub*.
3. __Stream Three__ <br/> *Python*, *Django*, *Heroku*, *Git*, *GitHub* and *MySQL*.

## Technology Descriptions
* **HTML5** <br/> HTML5 was designed to supersede both HTML 4 and XHTML by providing web developers with a simpler standard that includes several new features for the modern web. The table below includes a list of new elements, or tags, introduced in HTML5 that are used to define the structure of a document. 
* **CSS** <br/> CSS. Stands for "Cascading Style Sheet." Cascading style sheets are used to format the layout of Web pages. They can be used to define text styles, table sizes, and other aspects of Web pages that previously could only be defined in a page's HTML.
* **Javascript** <br/> What is JavaScript? JavaScriptÂ® (often shortened to JS) is a lightweight, interpreted, object-oriented language with first-class functions, and is best known as the scripting language for Web pages, but it's used in many non-browser environments as well.
* **Cloud9** <br/> Cloud9 IDE is an online integrated development environment, published as open source from version 2.0, until version 3.0. It supports multiple programming languages, including C, C++, PHP, Ruby, Perl, Python, JavaScript with Node.js, and Go.
It is written almost entirely in JavaScript, and uses Node.js on the back-end. The editor component uses Ace.
* **Git** <br/> Git is a version control system for tracking changes in computer files and coordinating work on those files among multiple people. It is primarily used for source code management in software development, but it can be used to keep track of changes in any set of files. As a distributed revision control system, it is aimed at speed, data integrity, and support for distributed, non-linear workflows.
* **GitHub** <br/> GitHub Inc. is a web-based hosting service for version control using Git. It is mostly used for computer code. It offers all of the distributed version control and source code management functionality of Git as well as adding its own features.
* **Python** <br/> Python is an interpreted high-level programming language for general-purpose programming. Created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991, Python has a design philosophy that emphasizes code readability, notably using significant whitespace.
* **Flask** <br/> Flask is a micro web framework written in Python. It is classified as a microframework because it does not require particular tools or libraries.
* **MongoDB** <br/> MongoDB is a free and open-source cross-platform document-oriented database program. Classified as a NoSQL database program, MongoDB uses JSON-like documents with schemata.
* **MySQL** <br/> MySQL is an open-source relational database management system. Its name is a combination of "My", the name of co-founder Michael Widenius's daughter, and "SQL", the abbreviation for Structured Query Language.
* **Django** <br/> Django is a free and open-source web framework, written in Python, which follows the model-view-template architectural pattern. It is maintained by the Django Software Foundation, an independent organization established as a 501 non-profit.
* **Heroku** <br/> Heroku is a cloud platform as a service (PaaS) supporting several programming languages. Heroku, one of the first cloud platforms, has been in development since June 2007, when it supported only the Ruby programming language, but now supports Java, Node.js, Scala, Clojure, Python, PHP, and Go. For this reason, Heroku is said to be a polyglot platform as it lets the developer build, run and scale applications in a similar manner across all the languages.


## Note

This is all just learning, so don't expect amazing README content right now.
