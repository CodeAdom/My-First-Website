# My Very First Web Page

Welcome! This is my first web page and I'm try to utilise basic coding skills.

## Project Aim

The initial aim of this project is to build a working website using front end development techniques.

## Contents

The site will contain front end development code and tools to demonstrate progression. Each stream will focus on different code utility. The main languages focused on each stream will be:

1. __Stream One__ <br/> *HTML5*, *CSS*, *Javascript*, *Cloud9*, *Git* and *GitHub*.
2. __Stream Two__ <br/> *Python*, *Flask*, *MongoDB*, *MySQL*, *Git* and *GitHub*.
3. __Stream Three__ <br/> *Python*, *Django*, *Heroku*, *Git*, *GitHub* and *MySQL*.

## Note:

This is all just learning, so don't expect amazing README content right now.
